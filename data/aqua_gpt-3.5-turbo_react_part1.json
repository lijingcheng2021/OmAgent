Since only 1 out of 20 marbles pulled out the second time was black, we can infer that the bag currently doesn't contain many black marbles.

Given that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the daily requirement of vitamin A, it seems highly unlikely that grams are the correct unit for this calculation.\nThought 8: The most logical conclusion is that we need to convert the daily percentage requirements to milligrams or micrograms and then calculate the required amount of the health food based on those figures.\nThought 9: Let's convert the percentages to milligrams or micrograms. Since there are no specific values mentioned, we will have to use rough estimations. Let's assume the total required daily amount of vitamin E is around 10 milligrams and vitamin A is around 800 micrograms (0.8 milligrams) for an adult.\nThought 10: Based on those estimations, 1 gram of the health food provides 0.9 milligrams of vitamin E and 0.8 milligrams of vitamin A. To get at least the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins, we need at least 10 milligrams of vitamin E and 0.8 milligrams of vitamin A from this food.\nThought 11: Let's calculate how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\nAction 6: Finish[answer]",
