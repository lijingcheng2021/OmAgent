Let x be the number of copper coins and y be the number of brass coins. \n- From the given information, we have the equation 20x + 25y = 340 (in cents).\n- We also know from the question that the total number of coins brought after one dive is x + y.\n- We need to minimize x, so we can set y = 0 to find the minimum number of copper coins.\n- Substituting y = 0 into the equation, we get 20x = 340, which gives x = 17.\n- Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins brought is 17, which corresponds to answer choice (E) 0.",

This means the total cost is still $300, but she is buying more articles. We need to find the new selling price of each article after the decrease. \n\nAction 1: Search[price decrease]\n- Search found: \"A decrease of 15% means the new price is 85% of the original price\"\n\nThought 2:\nSo if the new price is 85% of the original price, the original price would be 100%. If we let x be the original price, we can set up an equation to solve for the new selling price.\n\nAction 2: Lookup[original price]\n- The original price is $300.\n\nThought 3:\nLet's use the equation to find the new selling price: 0.85x = $300. We know that the total cost is $300 for the articles.\n\nAction 3: Finish[$300 / (5+5) = $300 / 10 = $30]\n- The new selling price of each article is $30, which is not in the answer choices provided. Let's re-evaluate our steps. \n\nThought 4:\nI made a mistake in calculating the new selling price. The 15% decrease means that the price is now 85% of the original price, not 100%. Let's correct this and calculate again.\n\nAction 4: Search[15% decrease formula]\n- Search found: \"To find the price after a decrease of x%, you can use the formula: new price = original price - (original price * (x/100))\"\n\nThought 5:\nWe can use the formula to find the new selling price. Let's do the calculation correctly this time.\n\nAction 5: Finish[$300 / 10 = $30 / article * 85% = $25.5]\n- The new selling price of each article is $25.5, which is not in the answer choices provided. Let's reevaluate our steps. \n\nThought 6:\nI made a mistake again. I need to include the part where Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300. This means the new selling price must be based on the total number of articles she can purchase with $300, including the additional 5 articles.\n\nAction 6: Lookup[new total number of articles]\n- The total number of articles Anna can buy with $300 is 10 (original 5 + 5 more).\n\nThought 7:\nLet's use the correct total number of articles to calculate the new selling price per article.\n\nAction 7: Finish[$300 / 10 = $30]\n- The new selling price of each article is $30.
